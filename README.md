Advent of Code 2022 in Python and Kotlin.

# Inputs

Inputs are stored in `input/input<day>` and `input/input<day>-sample`.

# Python

TODO: Days 15 and 17 are only partially implemented and Day 16 isn't implemented.

Run from the `python/src` folder:

- `python main.py <day>` to run a single day and print the results to stdout.
- `python main.py all` to run all days and to verify the outputs are correct.

There is one solver per day, in `day<day>.py`, based on the sample in `dayNN.py`.

The solutions to part one and part two are output to stdout.

# Kotlin

TODO: Days 3-25 are not implemented.

Run from the kotlin folder:

- `gradlew run --args "<day>"` to run a single day and print the results to stdout.
- `gradlew run --args "all"` to run all days and to verify the outputs are correct.

There is one solver per day, in `Solver<day>.kt`, based on the sample in `SolverNN.kt`.

The solutions to part one and part two are output to stdout.
