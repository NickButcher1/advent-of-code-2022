Advent of Code 2022

Run with:

- `python main.py <day>` to run a single day and print the results to stdout.
- `python main.py all` to run all days and to verify the outputs are correct.

Inputs are stored in `input/input<day>` and `input/input<day>-sample`.

There is one solver per day, in `day<day>.py`, based on the sample in `dayNN.py`.

The solutions to part one and part two are output to stdout.
